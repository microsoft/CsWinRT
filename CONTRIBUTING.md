# C#/WinRT Contributor's Guide

Below is our guidance for how to report issues, propose new features, and submit contributions via Pull Requests (PRs).

## Before you start, file an issue

Please follow this simple rule to help us eliminate any unnecessary wasted effort & frustration, and ensure an efficient and effective use of everyone's time - yours, ours, and other community members':

> üëâ If you have a question, think you've discovered an issue, would like to propose a new feature, etc., then find/file an issue **BEFORE** starting work to fix/implement it.

### Search Existing Issues First

Before filing a new issue, search existing open and closed issues first: It is likely someone else has found the problem you're seeing, and someone may be working on or have already contributed a fix!

If no existing item describes your issue/feature, great - please file a new issue:

### File a New Issue

* Don't know whether you're reporting an issue or requesting a feature? File an issue
* Have a question that you don't see answered in docs, videos, etc.? File an issue
* Want to know if we're planning on building a particular feature? File an issue
* Found an existing issue that describes yours? Great - upvote and add additional commentary / info / repro-steps / etc.

### Include Issue Details

**Please include as much information as possible in your issue**. The more information you provide, the more likely your issue/ask will be understood and implemented. Helpful information includes:

* What versions of .NET, C#/WinRT, and the SDK Projection you're using
* What tools and apps you're using (e.g. VS 2019, VSCode, etc.)
* What build of Windows your device is running
* Don't assume we're experts in setting up YOUR environment and don't assume we are experts in YOUR workflow. Teach us to help you!
* **We LOVE detailed repro steps!** What steps do we need to take to reproduce the issue? Assume we love to read repro steps. As much detail as you can stand is probably _barely_ enough detail for us!
* Prefer error message text where possible or screenshots of errors if text cannot be captured
* **If you intend to implement the fix/feature yourself then say so!** If you do not indicate otherwise we will assume that the issue is ours to solve, or may label the issue as `Help-Wanted`.

### DO NOT post "+1" comments

> ‚ö† DO NOT post "+1", "me too", or similar comments - they just add noise to an issue.

If you don't have any additional info/context to add but would like to indicate that you're affected by the issue, upvote the original issue by clicking its [+üòä] button and hitting üëç (+1) icon. This way we can actually measure how impactful an issue is.

## Development

### Fork, Clone, Branch and Create your PR

Once you've discussed your proposed feature/fix/etc. with a team member, and you've agreed on an approach or a spec has been written and approved, it's time to start development:

1. Fork the repo if you haven't already
1. Clone your fork locally
1. Create & push a feature branch
1. Create a Pull Request
1. Work on your changes

### Code Review

When you'd like the team to take a look, (even if the work is not yet fully complete), mark the PR as 'Ready For Review' so that the team can review your work and provide comments, suggestions, and request changes. It may take several cycles, but the end result will be solid, testable, conformant code that is safe for us to merge.

### Merge

Once your code has been reviewed and approved by the requisite number of team members, it will be merged into the master branch. Once merged, your PR will be automatically closed.
