# Authoring C#/WinRT Components

**Note**: C#/WinRT authoring support is in preview. See [Known Issues and Troubleshooting](#known-issues-and-troubleshooting) below for more details on what is supported.

## Overview

C#/WinRT provides support for authoring Windows Runtime components. You can write a library in C#, and specify that it is a `CsWinRTComponent` for C#/WinRT to produce a WinMD that any WinRT compatible language can use. For example, a Windows Runtime component written in C# can be used by a C++ program, via C#/WinRT and C++/WinRT.

## Authoring a C#/WinRT Component

It is recommended to use .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022 for C#/WinRT authoring scenarios. To author a new component, first create a C# **Class Library** project in Visual Studio. You will need to make the following modifications to the project.

1. In the library project file, update the `TargetFramework` property in order to access Windows Runtime APIs.

      ```xml
      <PropertyGroup>
            <!-- Choose your TargetFramework for the desired Windows SDK version -->
            <TargetFramework>net6.0-windows10.0.19041.0</TargetFramework>
      </PropertyGroup>
      ```

      To access Windows Runtime types, you need to set a specific Windows SDK version in the TFM. See [.NET 5 and later: Use the TFM option](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-enhance#net-5-and-later-use-the-target-framework-moniker-option) for more details on the supported versions.

2. Install the [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) NuGet package in your project.

3. Add the following C#/WinRT-specific properties to the project file. The `CsWinRTComponent` property specifies that your project is a Windows Runtime component, so that a WinMD file is generated for the component. 

      ```xml
      <PropertyGroup>
            <CsWinRTComponent>true</CsWinRTComponent>
      </PropertyGroup>
      ```

      See [C#/WinRT NuGet properties](../nuget/README.md) for more details on the available C#/WinRT properties.

4. Implement your runtime classes in the class files in your library project, following the necessary [WinRT guidelines and type restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/winrt-components/creating-windows-runtime-components-in-csharp-and-visual-basic#declaring-types-in-windows-runtime-components).

### Packaging your WinRT component

You may want to distribute and share your component as a NuGet package. To generate a NuGet package for the component, you can choose one of the options below. Your component can then be used in consuming apps by a `PackageReference`.

To make your component available as a NuGet package, it is important to include the DLLs necessary for C#/WinRT hosting. When you pack your C#/WinRT component, the hosting DLLs and WinMD are automatically added to your NuGet package, based on a `.nuspec` file.

- Option 1: [Create a package using the dotnet CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package-dotnet-cli). You can set the package properties in Visual Studio: right-click the project in Solution Explorer, choose **Properties**, and select the **Package** tab. You can also set these properties directly in `.csproj` file.

- Option 2: [Create a package using the nuget.exe CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package). This involves creating a `.nuspec` file.

  - If authoring your own `.nuspec`, you must include the following `file` entries for your component, `"MyAuthoredComponent"`. Note that the `TargetFramework` may vary. The required files include C#/WinRT targets files which supply the hosting DLLs for app consumers. Any dependencies of your component will need to be specified as well.

      ``` xml
      <files>
      <file src="$(TargetDir)MyAuthoredComponent.dll" 
            target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\MyAuthoredComponent.dll" />
      <file src="$(TargetDir)MyAuthoredComponent.winmd" 
            target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\winmd\MyAuthoredComponent.winmd" /> 
      <file src="$(TargetDir)Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.dll"  
            target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.dll" />
      
      <!-- Note: you must rename the CsWinRT.Authoring.Targets as follows -->
      <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\build\Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT.Authoring.targets"   
            target="buildTransitive\MyAuthoredComponent.targets" />
            
      <!-- buildTransitive is for consumers using PackageReference, build is for consumers using packages.config --> 
      <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\build\Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT.Authoring.targets"       
            target="build\MyAuthoredComponent.targets" />
      
      <!-- Include the managed DLLs -->
      <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\lib\net5.0\WinRT.Host.Shim.dll"                                  
            target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\WinRT.Host.Shim.dll" />  
      <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\lib\net5.0\WinRT.Runtime.dll"                                  
            target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\WinRT.Runtime.dll" />
      
      <!-- Include the native DLLs -->
      <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\runtimes\win-x64\native\WinRT.Host.dll"                                  
            target="runtimes\win-x64\native\WinRT.Host.dll" />
      <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\runtimes\win-x86\native\WinRT.Host.dll"                                  
            target="runtimes\win-x86\native\WinRT.Host.dll" />
      <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\runtimes\win-arm64\native\WinRT.Host.dll"                                  
            target="runtimes\win-arm64\native\WinRT.Host.dll" />
      
      </files>
      ```

## Consuming C#/WinRT Components

This section describes the steps needed to consume a C#/WinRT component for the following scenarios:

- [C++/WinRT desktop applications (Unpackaged)](#consuming-from-cwinrt-unpackaged)
- [C# desktop applications](#consuming-from-c-applications) (.NET 5 or later)
- [Packaged applications](#Consuming-from-packaged-applications)
- [Out of process components](#Consuming-an-out-of-process-component)

### Consuming from C++/WinRT (Unpackaged)

Consuming a C#/WinRT component from a C++/WinRT desktop application is supported by both package reference or project reference:

- **Package Reference**: In Visual Studio, right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and click **Manage NuGet packages** to search for and install the component package.

- **Project Reference**: In Visual Studio, right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and click **Add** -> **Reference**. Select the C#/WinRT component project under the **Projects** node. 
  - Note: If your authored component is built with C#/WinRT version 1.3.3 or earlier, you also need a file reference to the `*.winmd` generated in the authored component's output directory. To add a file reference, right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and click **Add** -> **Reference**. Select the file from the **Browse** node. 

**Application Manifest file**

For consumption of C#/WinRT components from unpackaged applications, you need to create an [application manifest file](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests) named `YourNativeApp.exe.manifest`. The application manifest file must specify activatable Windows Runtime classes in the DLL that the application will be making use of. At runtime, this directs activation of the componentâ€™s classes. See the [sample manifest file](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/tree/master/src/Samples/AuthoringDemo/CppConsoleApp/CppConsoleApp.exe.manifest) for an example.

Follow these steps to add an application manifest file to your project:

1. In Visual Studio, right click on the project node under **Solution Explorer** and click **Add -> New Item**. Search for the **Text File** template and name your file `YourNativeApp.exe.manifest`.

2. Add your activatable class registrations to the manifest file. Below is an example with a C#/WinRT component `MyAuthoredComponent` and activatable classes `WinRTComponent.Class*`. Note that `WinRT.Host.dll` must be specified as the file name.

      ```xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <assembly manifestVersion="1.0" xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
      <assemblyIdentity version="1.0.0.0" name="CppConsoleApp"/>
      <file name="WinRT.Host.dll">
      <activatableClass
            name="MyAuthoredComponent.Class1"
            threadingModel="both"
            xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:winrt.v1" />
      <activatableClass
            name="MyAuthoredComponent.Class2"
            threadingModel="both"
            xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:winrt.v1" />
      </file>
      </assembly>
      ```

3. Modify the project to include the manifest file in the output when deploying the project. Right-click on the file in **Solution Explorer**, select **Properties**, and set the **Content** property to **True** using the drop-down arrow on the right.

### Consuming from C# applications

Consuming a C#/WinRT component from C#/.NET apps is supported by both package reference or project reference. This scenario is equivalent to consuming any ordinary C# class library and does not involve WinRT activation in most cases.

**Note:** With C#/WinRT 1.3.5 or later, project references to a C#/WinRT component require .NET 6.

### Consuming from packaged applications

Consuming C#/WinRT components from MSIX-packaged applications is supported with a few modifications.

- Consuming a C#/WinRT component from packaged C# apps is supported.
- Consuming a C#/WinRT component from a C++/WinRT packaged app (e.g., a Windows App SDK C++ application) is supported with a few modifications listed below. See the [Simple C#/WinRT component sample](../src/Samples/AuthoringDemo) (specifically the WinUI3CppApp) for an example.
  - If consuming via project reference, adding a project reference to the C#/WinRT component project in Visual Studio may result in the error: *"A reference to 'MyAuthoredComponent' cannot be added because it is incompatible with this project"*. To workaround this, unload the `.vcxproj` file and add the `ProjectReference` manually, for example:
      ```xml
      <ProjectReference Include="..\MyAuthoredComponent\MyAuthoredComponent.csproj" />
      ```
  - The app consumer needs to add the `ActivatableClass` registrations in the `Package.appxmanifest` file, like below. Note that packaged app consumers do not create a new application manifest (`.exe.manifest`) file.
      ```xml
      <Extensions>
        <Extension Category="windows.activatableClass.inProcessServer">
          <InProcessServer>
            <Path>WinRT.Host.dll</Path>
              <ActivatableClass ActivatableClassId="MyAuthoredComponent.Class1" ThreadingModel="both" />
              <ActivatableClass ActivatableClassId="MyAuthoredComponent.Class2" ThreadingModel="both" />
            </InProcessServer>
        </Extension>
      </Extensions>
      ```

### Consuming an out of process component

C#/WinRT supports authoring out-of-process components that can be consumed by Windows Runtime compatible languages. Currently, consuming an out-of-process component is supported for managed C# apps with the use of a packaging project. This scenario requires creating a `WinRT.Host.runtimeconfig.json` file, as demonstrated in the [background task component sample](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/tree/master/src/Samples/BgTaskComponent). Native C++ consumption of out-of-process C# components is not fully supported yet.

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

- Project reference support (from C++ and C# apps) for C#/WinRT authored components is available with .NET 6. Referencing a C#/WinRT authored component by project reference in a C# app is **not supported with .NET 5**.

- Hosting WinUI3 components is not fully supported yet.
