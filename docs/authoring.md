# Authoring Components

## Overview

**Note: Authoring Support is still in preview**

C#/WinRT provides support for authoring Windows Runtime components. You can write a library in C#, and specify that it is a `CsWinRTComponent` for C#/WinRT to produce a WinMD that any WinRT compatible language can use. For example, a library written in C# can be used by a C++ program, via C#/WinRT and C++/WinRT.
Managed apps only need a project or package reference to the authored component, and native apps will need some extra steps that we cover in this documentation.

## Authoring a C#/WinRT Component

To author your component, first create a project using the C# **Class Library (.NET Core)** template in Visual Studio. You will need to make the following modifications to the project.

1. In the library project file, update the `TargetFramework` property.

      ```xml
      <PropertyGroup>
            <!-- Choose your TargetFramework for the desired Windows SDK projection -->
            <TargetFramework>net5.0-windows10.0.19041.0</TargetFramework>
      </PropertyGroup>
      ```

      C#/WinRT projects require Windows API version specific .NET frameworks. The following versions are supported:

      - **net5.0-windows10.0.17763.0**
      - **net5.0-windows10.0.18362.0**
      - **net5.0-windows10.0.19041.0**

2. Install the latest version of the [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) NuGet package.

3. Add the following C#/WinRT specific properties to the project file. The `CsWinRTComponent` property specifies that your project is a Windows Runtime component, so that a WinMD file is generated for the component. The `CsWinRTWindowsMetadata` property provides a source for Windows Metadata and is required as of the latest C#/WinRT version.

      ```xml
      <PropertyGroup>
            <CsWinRTComponent>true</CsWinRTComponent>
            <CsWinRTWindowsMetadata>10.0.19041.0</CsWinRTWindowsMetadata>
      </PropertyGroup>
      ```

4. Implement your runtime classes in the class files in your library project, following the necessary [WinRT guidelines and type restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/winrt-components/creating-windows-runtime-components-in-csharp-and-visual-basic#declaring-types-in-windows-runtime-components).


### Packaging your component

To generate a NuGet package for the component, you can choose one of the following methods:

- If you want to generate a NuGet package every time you build the project, add the following property to the project file.

    ```xml
    <PropertyGroup>
        <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>
    </PropertyGroup>
    ```

- Alternatively, you can generate a NuGet package by right clicking the project in **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Pack**.

To make your component available as a NuGet package, it is important to include the DLLs necessary for C#/WinRT hosting. When you pack your C#/WinRT component the DLLs/WinMD are automatically added to your nupkg, based on a nuspec generated from your project file.

**If you are going to write your own nuspec**, then you should make sure your nuspec contains the following ```file``` entries for your component ```MyAuthoredComponent``` (note: your TargetFramework may vary). This is so our targets that supply the DLLs for any consumers of your package work.  
Similarly, any other dependencies, e.g. `Microsoft.WinUI`, will need to be included in your nuspec as well.

``` xml
<files>
  <file src="$(TargetDir)MyAuthoredComponent.dll"        target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\MyAuthoredComponent.dll" />
  <file src="$(TargetDir)MyAuthoredComponent.winmd"      target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\winmd\MyAuthoredComponent.winmd" />
  
  <file src="$(TargetDir)Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.dll"  target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.dll" />
   
  <!-- Note: you must rename the CsWinRT.Authoring.Targets as follows -->
  <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\buildTransitive\Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT.Authoring.targets"   
        target="buildTransitive\MyAuthoredComponent.targets" />
        
  <!-- buildTransitive is for consumers using packagereference, build is for consumers using packages.config --> 
  <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\build\Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT.Authoring.targets"       
        target="build\MyAuthoredComponent.targets" />
   
  <!-- Include the managed DLLs -->
  <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\lib\net5.0\WinRT.Host.Shim.dll"                                  
        target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\WinRT.Host.Shim.dll" />
    
  <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\lib\net5.0\WinRT.Runtime.dll"                                  
        target="lib\$(TargetFramework)\WinRT.Runtime.dll" />
    
  <!-- Include the native DLLs -->
  <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\runtimes\win-x64\native\WinRT.Host.dll"                                  
        target="runtimes\win-x64\native\WinRT.Host.dll" />
    
  <file src="C:\Path\To\CsWinRT\NugetDir\runtimes\win-x86\native\WinRT.Host.dll"                                  
        target="runtimes\win-x86\native\WinRT.Host.dll" />
</files>
```

Your component can then be used in consuming apps by a `PackageReference`.

## Consuming C#/WinRT Components

This section describes the steps needed to consume a C#/WinRT component from the following kinds of applications:

- [C++/WinRT desktop applications](#Consuming-from-C++/WinRT)
- [C# .NET 5+ desktop applications](#Consuming-from-C#-applications)
- [Out of process components](#Consuming-an-out-of-process-component)
- [Packaged applications](#Consuming-from-packaged-applications)

### Consuming from C++/WinRT

Consuming a C#/WinRT component from a C++/WinRT desktop application is supported by both package reference or project reference.

- For package references, simply right-click on the native project node and click **Manage NuGet packages** to find and install the component package.

- For project references, you also currently need a reference to the component's generated WinMD. The WinMD can be found in the output directory of the authored component's project. To add both the project and WinMD references, right-click on the native project node, and click **Add** -> **Reference**. Select the C#/WinRT component project under the **Projects** node and the generated WinMD file from the **Browse** node.

For native consumption of C#/WinRT components, you also need to create a manifest file named `YourNativeApp.exe.manifest`. If your app is packaged with MSIX, then you don't need to include the manifest file. In the case that you do make a manifest, you need to add activatable class registrations for the public types in your component. We provide an [authoring sample](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/tree/master/src/Samples/AuthoringDemo/CppConsoleApp) with an example manifest file. To create the manifest file:

1. In Visual Studio, right click on the project node under **Solution Explorer** and click **Add -> New Item**. Search for the **Text File** template and name your file `YourNativeApp.exe.manifest`.

2. Add your activatable class registrations to the manifest file. You can use the manifest file from [this sample](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/tree/master/src/Samples/AuthoringDemo/CppConsoleApp) as an example.

3. Modify the project to include the manifest file in the output when deploying the project. Right-click on the file in **Solution Explorer**, select **Properties**, and set the **Content** property to **True** using the drop-down arrow on the right.

### Consuming from C# applications

Consuming a C#/WinRT component from C#/.NET 5 is supported by both package reference or project reference. This scenario is equivalent to consuming any ordinary C# class library and does not involve WinRT activation in most cases.

### Consuming an out of process component

C#/WinRT supports authoring out-of-process components that can be consumed by other languages. Currently, consuming an out-of-process component is supported for managed C# apps with the use of a packaging project. A manual WinRT.Host.runtimeconfig.json file is currently required for this scenario, which is demonstrated in the sample below. Native consumption of out-of-process components is not fully supported yet.

For an example of authoring and consuming an out-of-process C#/WinRT component, see the [background task component sample](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/tree/master/src/Samples/BgTaskComponent).

### Consuming from packaged applications

Consuming C#/WinRT components from MSIX-packaged applications is supported for some scenarios. The latest Visual Studio Preview version is recommended for packaging scenarios.

- Consuming a C#/WinRT component from packaged C# apps is supported.
- Consuming a C#/WinRT component from packaged C++ apps is supported as a package reference, and requires the `exe.manifest` file.
