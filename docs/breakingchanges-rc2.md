# Breaking Changes for C#/WinRT in .NET 5.0 RC2

1.  With IDynamicInterfaceCastable support, all projected interfaces can now use a simple C#-style cast.  Unprojected interfaces must use the `.As<T>()` extension method.

2.  Calling any of the [RuntimeReflectionExtension](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.reflection.runtimereflectionextensions?view=net-5.0) methods is likely to cause issues. The runtime type of a projected class now carries around some state information and helper methods, and should not be dynamically reflected on.

3. Some WinRT types may have differences in default values when projected. This may raise issues if relying on default values. For example, `Windows.Foundation.DateTime` is projected to `System.DateTimeOffset` in C# and these types have different default values.

4. The latest Roslyn compiler is required for C# projects, which come with the following NuGet package:

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset" Version="3.8.0-4.20472.6"
    ```

5. In RC2 we have added strong-name signing to the runtime assembly, **winrt.runtime.dll**. Assemblies built with the previous version of **winrt.runtime.dll** are not compatible with this change. This includes **Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Net.dll** (the Windows SDK), **Microsoft.WinUI.dll** (WinUI), and any other C#/WinRT projection assemblies. Builds that combine pre-RC2 and post-RC2 projection assemblies may fail with a `CS0012` error, with the message of a missing reference to an assembly with `PublicIKeyToken=null`. This indicates an older assembly without strong name signing. The solution is to update all dependencies to their .NET 5 RC2 versions.

6. The `add` event accessor return type has changed from `System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime.EventRegistrationToken` to `void`. We no longer project the `System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime` type, as it has been removed from .NET5.

7. This update of C#/WinRT with .NET5 RC2 is not compatible with WinUI 3 Preview 2. This will be fixed in WinUI3 Preview 3.
