# Embedded C#/WinRT Support

**Note**: Embedded support is currently **in preview** in C#/WinRT v1.4.1.

## Overview

Embedded support is a C#/WinRT feature that allows you to compile the WinRT runtime for C# and the projection sources into your library or app's output. This is done by setting the build property `CsWinRTEmbedded` to `true` in the app or library's project file. You must specify the types in your component or app which you want to embed using the `CsWinRTIncludes` property.
The specified types will be projected and embedded into the project's *.dll*. 
This means that projects using embedded support no longer have a dependency on the projection assembly for the component, `WinRT.Runtime.dll`, or `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.dll` in the case of dependencies on the Windows SDK projection.

Embedded support introduces new features and benefits to the C#/WinRT toolchain:
 * Decreased component/app size: The developer only needs to include the minimum necessary parts of the Windows SDK required by their component or app, reducing the size of the output .dll significantly.
 * Downlevel support: App developers on .NET 5+ can target Windows 7 (`net5.0-windows`) and light-up on Windows 10 
  (and Windows 11) when consuming an embedded .NET 5+ library. 
 * Removes the need for multi-targeting: Library authors can support all .NET Standard 2.0 app consumers, including .NET 5+, without the need for multi-targeting. App consumers are able to target any .NET Standard 2.0 compatible TFM (e.g. `netcoreapp3.1`, `net48`, and `net5.0-windows`).

It is important to remember that embedded support constrains the scope of Windows Runtime types to your binary (e.g., usage of WinRT types must be self-contained).

For an example, you can look at the [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/tree/master/src/Samples/TestEmbedded).

## Scenarios

This feature allows C# apps and libraries to target `net5.0` (and above), .NET Framework 4.6.1+, `netcoreapp3.1`, and `netstandard2.0` while also using Windows SDK types.
Moreover, a library can target `netstandard2.0` and be able to run on .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5 or later. 

Note: the `netstandard2.0` generated projection is not optimized for .NET 5 and will not be as performant.

## Usage 

Using embedded support allows you to target TFMs that are not tied to a specific Windows SDK version, as well as older versions of .NET.
You will need to set a few properties:
  * `CsWinRTEmbedded` - must be set to `true` to include the sources
  * `CsWinRTIncludes` - Specify the types to be projected; error `CS0246` will highlight any missing namespaces
  * `CsWinRTWindowsMetadata` - must be set to the Windows SDK release to use for Windows APIs
  * `LangVersion` - must be set to `9` because the CsWinRT generated sources use C# 9

Targeting `netstandard2.0` requires adding the following two package references:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="System.Memory" Version="4.5.4" />
<PackageReference Include="System.Runtime.Extensions" Version="4.3.1" />
```

Here is an example project file for a library cross-targeting and embedding a C#/WinRT generated projection.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net6.0-windows;net5.0-windows;netstandard2.0</TargetFrameworks>
    <Platforms>x64;x86</Platforms>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <LangVersion>9</LangVersion>
    <CsWinRTEmbedded>true</CsWinRTEmbedded>
    <CsWinRTWindowsMetadata>10.0.19041.0</CsWinRTWindowsMetadata>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT" Version="$(CsWinRTVersion)" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\path\CppwinrtComponent\CppwinrtComponent.vcxproj" />
  </ItemGroup> 
  
  <ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'">
    <PackageReference Include="System.Memory" Version="4.5.4" />
    <PackageReference Include="System.Runtime.Extensions" Version="4.3.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
    
  <PropertyGroup>
    <CsWinRTIncludes>
      CppwinrtComponent;
      Windows.Devices.Geolocation;
      Windows.Foundation;
    </CsWinRTIncludes>
  </PropertyGroup>
 
</Project>
```

**Note**: You will need to enable Windows Desktop Compatible for all your referenced C++/WinRT components, either via the project properties dialog or manually in the `.vcxproj` file.

## Common issues and troubleshooting

- If you try to use an embedded projection of a native (C++/WinRT) component via ProjectReference, you may encounter a runtime error `CLASS_NOT_REGISTERED`.
You can fix this by unloading the native component project in Visual Studio, and adding the following:

  ```vcxproj
    <PropertyGroup Label="Configuration">
      <DesktopCompatible>true</DesktopCompatible>
    </PropertyGroup>
  ```

  Alternatively, you can right-click the C++ project in Visual Studio, select **Properties** > **General** > **Project Defaults**,
  and set Windows Desktop Compatible to Yes for all configurations/platforms.
