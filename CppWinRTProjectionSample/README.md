# C#/WinRT E2E Sample

This sample demonstrates how to invoke C#/WinRT to build a .NET5 projection for a C++/WinRT Runtime Component, create a NuGet package for the component, and reference the NuGet from a .NET5 console app.

**Note**: This sample is accurate as of RC1, and there are expected tooling improvements to be made for the developer experience in our future GA release.
