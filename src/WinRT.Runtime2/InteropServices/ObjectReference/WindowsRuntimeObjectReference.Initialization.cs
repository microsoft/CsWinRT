        //
        // In the first case, the actual COM object we are going to wrap is the inner interface object,

            //
            //   1) COM aggregation: we would need to do an 'AddRef' on the inner instance (for the object reference),

            //      entire pair of 'AddRef'/'Release' on the inner object in the successful case.
            //   2) Not aggregation: we would need to do an 'AddRef' on the new instance (for the object reference),
            //      but then we'd do an unconditional 'Release' at the end of this method. This is because the
            //      runtime (ie. 'ComWrappers') would already be holding its own 'AddRef' on this same object, as

            // transfer the ownership to the returned object reference, which would handle releases later on.

        // This results in the following object graph (simplified):
        //
        // 'Grid' -> 'Button' -> CCW -> 'RoutedEventHandler' -> closure -> RCW -> 'Grid'.
        //
        // Without the reference tracking infrastructure allowing the GC to track objects throughout this graph,

        //   - The native 'Grid' is keeping the native 'Button' alive
        //   - The native 'Button' is keeping the event handler alive
        //   - That is in turn keeping the initial 'Grid' RCW alive
        //
        // Reference tracking allows the GC to distinguish which 'AddRef' calls are from native objects, and which ones
        // come from managed objects, in the graph it can crawl on the managed heap. Furthermore, the reference tracker
        // infrastructure also allows the GC to crawl through objects across boundaries, to reconstruct the real dependency
