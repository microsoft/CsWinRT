# The C#/WinRT Language Projection

C#/WinRT provides packaged WinRT projection support for the C# language.  It is compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 and later and does not require any built-in knowledge of WinRT by the C# compiler.  

C#/WinRT is part of the [xlang](https://github.com/microsoft/xlang) family of projects that help developers create APIs that can run on multiple platforms and be used with a variety of languages.
